I liked the network, the teams that formed from there at hackathons, and the career acumen I found in seniors who were in it vs who were not. By the time I started ctp I already had my capital one offer, and I felt that the reasons I wanted to join the program earlier had sort of faded. I still had an amazing exp namely in 3 folds: 1) Emily's 1v1 sessions on word choices on my resume, I think I spent a lot of time and the end result cannot be without her help...btw (all the better when Brandan Collins shared his positive feedback since I've sent him my resumes for edits like 3-4 times that year and the final one he really liked...Tbh I think its a lot better now https://yasinehsan.com/YasinEhsan.pdf) 2) my bond with Matthew and Rageeb only grew. We both did the codepath ios bootcamp one year ago where we met and I had know idea how we inspired each other to become better...I feel the peer effect is real and drive each other to become better. I am happy where we are at right now and I think we can rise way above and make breakthru software products and if and when that happens ctp deserves cred in fostering a home for us to get closer, more ambitious and driven 3) the react workshops which I paid zero attention to but I sat thru it...I believe in learning in layers so instead of trying to learn it all at first impression to get exposed to it and later come and hone the skill/lang thru practice. I can say I started picking up react again for my side hustle and I was so easily able to pick it up since the words like ""props"" and ""js sytanx"" was in my subconcious from edgardo's lectures. Fun fact so heres some direct dividends of these lectures: for our side hustle https://chronogrp.com/ I built this website https://www.goldenblocksconstruction.com/ which client payed 2k and essentially took me approx. a day to build...all possible thru the first impressions I had with react. Lastly I can say one advice for future CTP program sessions is to half say 50-75 of total lectures be on data structures and algo...anyone can watch a youtube video and paste that on their ""projects"" section and that six-fig job intv, but most will not pass it. AT the end of the day passing the intv has a lot to do with luck but the part its not should be solid 10/10. Thats what I feel this program can curate to aim more students be able to solve leetcode medium questions on av 20 mins (the hire bar for fb)...which I can no way do but also don't put much time into since my focus has shifted...but if I give advice that's what students need. If they are able to master interview and know their confidence in the skills they will - almost garunteed - find a way to land the intv and figure out all nessesary skills (like react etc) to appear more marketable.
